Review roles that Everyone will be doing and set ground rules

Project run down

Weekly meetings (When can everyone meet, are all the weeks the same, etc)

Proper formatting (Where to talk in discord, uploads, making sure everything is neat for submission)

Weekly follow ups (How I plan contacting you all and how to respond in discord)

Plan of Action (How we will go about the project) 

6:30 -	Meeting started

4/4 Attendance - Everyone present

6:35 -	Roles that everyone is doing and set ground rules

Elbie Saysombath: Software Engineer, Responsible for programming the stepper motor code for the incidents of spices and working on GUI functionality

Adam Six: Design Lead/Systems Engineer, responsible for the design of the appliance gathering/producing the mechanics of the spice dispenser and overall functionality

Jacob Stark: Electrical systems lead/Project Lead, responsible for the project as a whole, and the electrical work for the connection for the stepper motor, GUI, and power

Collin Pruden: software/hardware Engineer/ Team Leader, responsible for the team as a whole. Works along side with Elbie and Jacob to build the GUI, and connection for the stepper motor

Collin Will be out  timekeeper: Mark attendance, meeting start/end, topics, time crunch deadline management.

Reaffirming time/schedule availability. If a person misses a meeting they can look at the minutes or one team member may brief the missing person to update on what they missed out on the meeting

Discord will be our main communication and Github is where we will upload all of our documentation, codes, project.

` `Discussing team contribution and evaluation when presenting our project.

6:50 -	Project Run down

` `Overall Design:

Designed with ease-of-use in mind, with a single point of input through a touchscreen

Touchscreen controls a Pi, which controls internal motors

Everything is done on the backend, reduces user knowledge requirement

Includes easily removable pieces for ease of cleaning

Internal Design:

Planetary gear system for rack designed to increase gear ratio between the rack and the motor

Containers have internal corkscrew to break up clumped spices

Sideways meat grinder-style dispensing for consistent output

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi4

Able to handle many of the tasks necessary to run things like the motors and relays in the system, while monitoring all the input of the device itself

Can handle multiple inputs and outputs needed for many projects, which makes it a reliable device to use.


Software:

GUI ( Interface)

Easy to use

Select one spice, amount of increments 

Stepper Motor 

Works in line with the GUI

7:38 -	Weekly Meeting Info

Meeting every Friday 6:30pm.

7:45 -	Formatting

Discord channel. Text channels are already properly set up for correct content.

7:55 -	Follow - ups

Every week, team leader and project manager will contact and assign tasks and make sure members are up to date and relay project progress. Collin sets deadlines, Jacob will track the progress of members. 

8:10 -	Plan of action

Finalize project

the models that Adam is m making and the redesign that were going to have,

Working on the switch to servo motors from steppers.

Continue Research in any relating existing products or similarities.

Look into more codes to help the stepper motor and create a pretty GUI

Record all resources in our discord and communicate.  Work on the model in 3D software.

8:49 -	Wrap up/End of Meeting

Making sure all current assignments are done.

8:56 - End of Meeting
